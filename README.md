Some fun with little data for La Conf

### Audience Instructions:

Fill out [the survey](http://bit.ly/laconf) and enjoy the show.

## Overview

This code downloads the [survey results from WuFoo](http://bit.ly/laconf),
calculates [the distances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance)
between each person's answers, and uses a
[hierarchical clustering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering)
algorithm (using
[complete-linkage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete-linkage_clustering))
to figure out where people should sit during lunch for "optimal conversation".

It's probably completely broken.
